# Overview

This project shows the use of TypeScript to build a Notes App.  TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. With TypeScript you are able to code in FrontEnd features with the BackEnd Code.

The Notes App that I built allows for the local storage of notes that include a title, and a tag.  The tag allows you to categorize notes together, and then you are able to search by title or tag.  There is the ability to create, edit, and delete notes.  Also, you can create, edit, and delete tags.

I chose this project to practice using typescript and to understand how it can be useful when making basic functional programs.  I learned that it is similar to JavaScript, but also takes practice to keep track of everything.

# Future Work

- Make notes as building program to ensure proper comments are provided.
- Manage time to include practice before starting project.
- Plan to use 3X the amount of time as other coders so I can grasp the concepts with hands on experience.
